        <h3>Challenge</h3>
        <p>The E-learnify project aims to solve the problem of limited access to quality education, particularly in
            underserved areas. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive online education system that is accessible to
            learners of all ages, regardless of their location or socioeconomic background.</p>
        <p>While the E-learnify platform cannot address all the challenges in education, such as lack of technology
            access or funding, it can serve as a useful tool to increase access to quality education for those with
            internet connectivity.</p>
        <p>The platform is designed for learners of all ages, from young children to adults seeking to continue their
            education or acquire new skills. It is open to individuals interested in learning and improving their
            skills, regardless of their location or background.</p>

        <h3>Risks</h3>
        <p>Technical Risks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Compatibility issues between different technologies</li>
            <li>Performance issues under high traffic</li>
            <li>Security vulnerabilities without proper implementation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Non-technical Risks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Copyright or intellectual property issues with content usage</li>
            <li>Communication or coordination issues within the team</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Infrastructure</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Branching and Merging: We will use the GitHub flow for branching and merging, creating feature branches
                and merging them back into the main branch after completion and testing.</li>
            <li>Deployment: We will deploy the application using Heroku, a simple and cost-effective solution for web
                application deployment.</li>
            <li>Populating App with Data: We will manually collate data and use it to populate the application.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Existing Solutions</h3>
        <p>There are existing online learning platforms like Coursera, Udacity, Udemy, and edX. While they offer online
            courses, they differ in terms of course offerings, target audiences, pricing, and teaching methodologies.
        </p>

        <h3>Inspiration</h3>
        <p>Our project was inspired by our team's diverse skill sets and the desire to test and expand our capabilities.
            Emmanuel, with his expertise in Flutter mobile development, wanted to explore full-stack development and
            broaden his skill set. Grace, a skilled UI/UX designer with a background in teaching, aimed to apply her
            design skills to frontend development and create visually appealing websites. We saw this project as an
            opportunity to leverage our individual strengths while learning new skills.</p>
        <p>At the core of our inspiration was the goal to contribute to the field of education. We wanted to address the
            challenge of limited access to quality education, especially in underserved areas. Our aim was to create an
            online learning platform, E-learnify, that would empower learners of all backgrounds and provide them with
            the resources they need to pursue their educational goals.</p>
        <p>This project is a Portfolio Project for Holberton School, where we are honing our skills and demonstrating
            our abilities. You can find the GitHub repository for the project <a
                href="https://github.com/your-github-repo">here</a>.</p>
